<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>The <strong>Flagship</strong> project is inspired by the recent buzz around <a href="http://12factor.net">12factor applications</a> and <a href="http://12factor.net">Microservices</a>.</p>

<p>However, the example is slightly more inspired by the notion that everyone should understand how to build Microservices from scratch with just a few dependencies. Most of the recent server-side apps I've built tend to start with the basic concepts and app structure described below. There are also several open source projects that start with similar foundations; <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">Spring Boot</a> and <a href="http://dropwizard.io/">Dropwizard</a> are a few examples.</p>

<p>As applications grow (multiple apps, multiple services), I'm also a slight fan of having all the services or components within large systems reside in a single, versioned repo although, I'll save that conversation for a future example.</p>

<h3>
<a id="project-structure" class="anchor" href="#project-structure" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Structure</h3>

<p>The example walks you through a basic Java Microservice in a few steps. For discussion purposes, I've captured the steps via the below Git tags -</p>

<pre><code>git tag -ln

v0.1            Initial App
v0.2            Introducing Guice and App Environment
v0.3            Introducing Jetty and Jersey
v0.4            Introducing HealthChecks and Jackson
v0.5            Basic persistence with MyBatis and MySQL
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a id="v01-initial-app" class="anchor" href="#v01-initial-app" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>(v0.1) Initial App</h3>

<p>The v0.1 tag starts with a simple Java class - App.java. The App includes both start and stop methods as well as an initial test class. The test class extends AppRunner which will be used for both integration and acceptance tests.</p>

<p>I've used maven as the build tool with a plugin for shaded jars.</p>

<p>Current dependencies are slf4j and junit.</p>

<h3>
<a id="v02-introducing-guice-and-app-environments" class="anchor" href="#v02-introducing-guice-and-app-environments" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>(v0.2) Introducing Guice and App Environments</h3>

<p>v0.2 makes a slight nod to Agile web development and Rails by introducing Development, Test, and Production environments. The Environment class leverages both Java property files and local env variables. Loading config settings via operating system <em>environment variables</em> is a characteristic of <a href="http://12factor.net/config">12factor apps</a>. The Environment is injected via Guice although, Spring would have worked just as easily.</p>

<p>New dependencies include just Guice.</p>

<h3>
<a id="v03-introducing-jetty-and-jersey" class="anchor" href="#v03-introducing-jetty-and-jersey" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>(v0.3) Introducing Jetty and Jersey</h3>

<p>I've used the Guice Servlet lib and Jersey's Guice contribs in conjunction with Jetty (Guice and Jersey) to stitch together the server component. I'll typically pull in Jetty (by habit) although, Netty and Tomcat are also great choices.</p>

<p>You'll need to understand a bit about event listeners and filters - essentially the <a href="https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr315/">servlet specification</a> - to fullly grasp the lines 24-25 in the App class. At a high level, the Listener class enables Jetty with Guice support and the ResourceModule class describes the available REST endpoints via classes and annotations. FWIW - I always recommend reading the servlet spec if you're a serious Java developer - or at a minimum having at least one person on your team that has read the spec ;)</p>

<p>I've penciled in a RESTful NoopController that uses the javax.ws.rs package and simply returns plain text. The next tag will support the JSON media type. Note, the AppTest now becomes more interesting leveraging apache http components for acceptance tests which run via <em>mvn clean install</em>.</p>

<p>New dependencies include Jersey and Jetty.</p>

<h3>
<a id="v04-introducing-healthchecks-and-jackson" class="anchor" href="#v04-introducing-healthchecks-and-jackson" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>(v0.4) Introducing HealthChecks and Jackson</h3>

<p>Production support is always interesting - and, with a modern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service">PaaS</a>, support becomes slightly easier. I've created a BasicHealthCheck to return app specific health; size of in-memory queues, connected sub-systems, etc. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Management_Extensions">JMX</a> also works well although, the HealthCheck provides a nice step to introduce Jackson for JSON responses.</p>

<p>New dependencies include Jackson.</p>

<h3>
<a id="v05-basic-persistence-with-mybatis-and-mysql" class="anchor" href="#v05-basic-persistence-with-mybatis-and-mysql" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>(v0.5) Basic persistence with MyBatis and MySQL</h3>

<p>I've always enjoyed <a href="http://blog.mybatis.org/">MyBatis</a>. It's a data mapping tool that's a step below pulling in a full-blown O/RM.</p>

<p>The last tag includes a Project model, controller, and data access object. The test directory includes both integration and acceptance tests for the GET Projects endpoint. The README.md file includes manual instructions for setting up your local database. It also makes a few assumptions around naming conventions.</p>

<p>New dependencies include MyBatis and MySQL.</p>
